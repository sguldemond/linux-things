# Issue I run into running Linux

## Laptop won't sleep when after lid close when headset is connected

Date: 2023-03-17
Hardware: Thinkpad T480s, Sony WH-1000XM3 (headset)
Software: Ubuntu MATE 22.04.02, BlueZ 5.64 (5.64-0ubuntu1)

When I close the lid when bluetooth headset is still connected, the red Thinkpad light does not start pulsing, indicating it is not going into sleep mode.

When I open the laptop I cannot easily wake it, maybe by holding down the power button for a bit, but not too long so it turns off.

I could try to install a newer version of bluez that might fix the issue, but I don't want to risk breaking bluetooth all together.

For now I'll live with the quirke, hopefully a new version of bluez will be available for my setup in the future.
